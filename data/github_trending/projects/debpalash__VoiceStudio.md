![A tour of the Electron app: voice cloning, voice design, dubbing, and model management](docs/media/electron/voicestudio.gif)

<p align="center"><sub>The new Electron desktop UI, captured from this branch with the bundled demo voice. Release builds may look different.</sub></p>

## Create with VoiceStudio

- **Clone & design voices** — use a reference recording or describe the voice you imagine.
- **Dub video** — transcribe, translate, assign speakers, and edit timed speech.
- **Dictate anywhere** — record, transcribe, and copy text with a floating recording widget.
- **Tell longer stories** — create multi-voice scripts, audiobooks, and batch jobs.
- **Choose your models** — manage speech and transcription engines, languages, and compute devices.

Start with **VoiceStudio** (default, powered by k2-fsa/OmniVoice), or choose another engine.

Local workflows run on your hardware. Remote services are optional; usage analytics requires consent.

## Get started

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio/releases/latest), then follow your platform guide:

**[macOS](docs/install/macos.md) · [Windows](docs/install/windows.md) · [Linux](docs/install/linux.md) · [Docker](docs/install/docker.md)**

Open **Voice cloning**, choose a voice or add a clean reference recording, enter your text, and generate. Install the required model when prompted. Hardware needs vary by engine; see [performance](docs/performance.md).

**Run the Electron preview from source:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debpalash/VoiceStudio.git
cd VoiceStudio
bun install
cd electron
bun run dev
```
